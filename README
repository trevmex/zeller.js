zeller.js

This file has two functions in it. One extends the String class to have a getDay method that can be used directly from a string that looks like a date.

Example:
"7/5/2010".getDay() => "Monday"

The other function is the one that calculates the day from the date. It is called zeller(), and for the above example it would be called like this:

zeller(5, 7, 2010) => "Monday"

The zeller function has a number of options, including:
- Returning an ISO week date-compliant number
- Using the Gregorian or Julian calendar
- Declaring an internationalized array of weekday strings
